# HarryPotterDownloader
A simple Python script to download [Harry Potter Audiobooks](https://hpaudiobooks.club/)

It currently lacks support for parameters or any customization, the only way to download a custom book is to set the `link` and `maximumPages` variables.
Plus, it isn't going to be very quick, I have written it for one-time use, so speed was not a factor for me.

Have fun!
