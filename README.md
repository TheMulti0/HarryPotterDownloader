# HarryPotterDownloader
A simple Python script to download [Harry Potter Audiobooks](https://hpaudiobooks.club/)

It currently lacks support for parameters or any customization, the only way to download a custom book is to set the `link` and `maximumPages` variables. <br/>
Plus, it isn't going to be very quick, I have written it for one-time use, so speed was not a factor for me.
In addition to that, the saved file names are very basic as well (`Chapter X.mp3`), but the video title remains nice.

P.S. Sorry for my terrible code-style (wich is actually fine? (- koutsie))

Have fun!
